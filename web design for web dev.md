# Web Design for Web Developers

## Beautiful Typography

- Use a font-size between 15 and 25 pixels
- Use (really) Big font sizes for headlines
	-  if the font size is very big, decrease the font-weight
- Use line spacing between 120% and 150%
- 45 to 90 characters per line
- use good fonts 
	- sans-serif (more natural, clean, simple, modern websites)
	- serif (red serif) (Traditional purposes, story telling, long reading)


## Using Colors like a pro

- use only one base color (create a darker or lighter from base color)
- use a tool if you want to use more colors
- use color to draw attentation
- never use black in your design
- choose colors wisely (it has its own meaning)
	- Red is a great color to use when power, passion, strength and excitement want to be transmitted. Brighter tones are more energetic and darker shades are more powerful and elegant.
	- Orange draws attention without being as overpowering as red. It means cheerfulness and creativity. Orange can be associated with friendliness, confidence, and courage.
	- Yellow is energetic and gives the feeling of happiness and liveliness. Also, it associates with curiosity, intelligence, brightness, etc.
	- Green is the color of harmony, nature, life and health. Also, it is often associated with money. In design, green can have a balancing and harmonizing effect.
	- Blue means patience, peace, trustworthiness, and stability. It is one of the most beloved colors, especially by men. It is associated with professionalism, trust and honor. That's actually why the biggest social networks use blue.
	- Purple is traditionally associated with power, nobility and wealth. In your design, purple can give a sense of wisdom, royalty, nobility, luxury, and mystery.
	- Pink expresses romance, passivity, care, peace, affection, etc.
	- Brown is the color of relaxation and confidence. Brown means earthiness, nature, durability, comfort, and reliability.



## Working with Images

- put text directly on the image, if images is quite dark
- solve it with overlay that turns it darker, or use color gradient
- put your text in a box, the box should be opaque or blur the whole image
- the floor fade (image fades at the bottom)
- overlay the image
	- ``` .darken { background-image: linear-gradient(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)), url(YOUR IMAGE HERE);}```  
- put text in a box
	- ```.text-box { background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); color: #fff; display: inline; padding: 10px;} ```

- Floor Fade
	- ```.floor-fade { background: linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6) ), url(YOUR IMAGE HERE); } ```


## Working with Icons
- Use icons to list features/steps
- use icons for actions and links
- Icons should not take a center stage
- use icon fonts whenever possible

## Spacing and layout
- use whitespace to make it look clean and have a room to breathe
	- put whitespace between your elements
	- put whitespace between your group of elements
	- put whitespace between your website's sections
	- but dont exaggerate

- define hierarchy
	- whitespace describes invisible relationships between the elements of your websites
	- establish a flow that corresponds to your content's message
	- use whitespace to build that flow
